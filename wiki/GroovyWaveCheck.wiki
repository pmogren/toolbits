#summary System Tray application to check for unread Google Waves

= Introduction =

System Tray application written in the Groovy scripting language which checks for unread Google Waves.


= Requirements =

Java 1.6 and Groovy 1.5.8 or higher.

For Linux need sun 1.6 upgrade 10 or higher which fixed the bug where the system tray did not work with all window managers - see bug id [http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6438179 6438179].  Doesn't appear to be working in latest 1.6 version of openjdk so you will need the sun jdk

= Tested =
  * Ubuntu 9.1 - Groovy Version: 1.5.8 JVM: 1.6.0_15
  * Windows XP - Groovy Version: 1.6.5 JVM: 1.6.0_15
